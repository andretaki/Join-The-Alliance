## Future Enhancement: Real-Time LLM-Driven Screening Call

An advanced, long-term feature enabling live conversational screening using Vercel serverless functions and generative AI:

### Core Architecture (Vercel-Based)

**Candidate Interaction via Amazon Connect**
- Connect plays initial Polly prompts (e.g., "Hi, I'd like to place an order‚Ä¶")
- Candidate responds; Connect records audio
- Integration with Vercel API routes via webhooks

**Real-Time Processing with Vercel Functions**
- Connect streams audio to Vercel API routes (`/api/screening/process-audio`)
- OpenAI Whisper API for low-latency transcription
- Vercel KV for conversation state management
- Vercel Edge Functions for ultra-low latency preprocessing

**LLM-Driven Conversation Generation**
- Vercel serverless functions invoke OpenAI GPT-4 API
- Dynamic prompt engineering based on conversation context
- Conversation history maintained in Vercel KV (Redis)
- Real-time scoring and evaluation

**Audio Synthesis & Playback**
- LLM output ‚Üí AWS Polly synthesis ‚Üí Connect plays response
- Vercel Blob storage for audio files
- Streaming audio responses for minimal latency

**Post-Call Analytics & Scoring**
- Store transcripts and metadata in Vercel Postgres
- OpenAI API for comprehensive response analysis
- Integration with existing application scoring system
- Real-time dashboard for HR teams

### Technical Implementation

**Vercel API Routes Structure:**
```
/api/screening/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ start-call.ts          # Initialize screening session
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ process-audio.ts       # Handle audio transcription
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ generate-response.ts   # LLM conversation generation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ synthesize-speech.ts   # Text-to-speech conversion
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ end-call.ts           # Finalize and score call
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ schedule.ts           # Schedule screening calls
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ webhook/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ connect.ts        # Amazon Connect webhook handler
```

**Key Technologies:**
- **Vercel Serverless Functions**: Replace AWS Lambda for processing
- **Vercel Edge Functions**: Ultra-low latency audio preprocessing
